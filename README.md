Project title=" Student Grade Generator"

Description..

In this project, I have created a program that takes in values for student marks and generates the required grades as per the requirements. i.e..

"Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade as follows: 

A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40."

Setup..

 I used HTML as the basic website generator, styled it with Css and added the Grade generator using else if with the Script.js file.
